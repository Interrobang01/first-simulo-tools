## Hello and welcome to First Simulo Tools, by me, Interrobang!

To join this wonderful world of tools, paste
`@interrobang/first_simulo_tools;https://github.com/Interrobang01/first-simulo-tools.git`
into the package manager and hit enter.

The remainder of this readme will be dedicated towards documenting the tools in this repo.

# Anglebox
The Anglebox tool is one of the most useful tools in the package.
To use it just click and drag two lines. I'm sure you can figure it out from there.
Press `ESC` to cancel the box.
Hold `shift` to... wait, that's not finished yet, nevermind
Hold `alt` to make aspects of the box centered on your cursor rather than the midpoint between your cursor and the start position.

# Curve
The curve tool allows you to make curves. Shocking.
Hold `shift` to make it snap to orthogonal lines.
Hold `alt` to make it centered on your cursor.

# Delete
Hold `del` to delete everything your mouse touches.
You can also do this without the tool, but it'll only delete 1 object per mouse press. The delete tool is for heavy-duty deleting.

# Disintegrate
Click to disintegrate. Simple!
Hold `del` to disintegrate everything your mouse touches. May cause recursive disintegration loops.

# Info
Click on stuff to view information on it in the console.

# Line
Click and drag to make a line tipped with spikes.
Hold `shift` to make it snap to orthogonal lines.
Hold `alt` to make it centered on your cursor.

# Move
Click and drag to move!
Hold `shift` to make it snap to orthogonal lines.
Hold `alt` to center the object on your cursor.

# Rotate
Rotate stuff, at long last.
Hold `shift` to make rotation absolute instead of additive. That means the object points towards your cursor.
Hold `ctrl` to snap to 22.5 degree increments.
Hold `alt` to make the pivot point your cursor, rather than the center of the object.

# Static Toggle
Switch between the three body types. Clicking goes between static and dynamic.
Hold `shift` to make everything under your mouse become static.
Hold `ctrl` to make everything under your mouse kinematic (which is usually a bad idea)
Hold `alt` to make everything under your mouse dynamic (meaning it's unanchored)


That's all for now. Have fun!
